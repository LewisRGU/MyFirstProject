    <h1>Work History</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Score Group plc</li>
                <p>
                    I served time over the summer as an assistant to STAMP (Score Training and Multimedia Productions).
                    My exploits included creating a site map of the current Score website and trying to design a more optimum layout;
                    processing company data with multimedia applications and reordering modules which were erroneously made
                    available to job roles that shouldn't have access to them in the online company training system.
                </p>
            <li>Bert Fowlie Butchers</li>
                <p>
                    Working in the food industry gave me valuable experience, both in the general world of work and as working
                    as part of a team. Being one of the busiest butchers in the area, it had a lot of quotas and orders
                    to meet on a daily basis and, as such, the work environment was fast paced and constantly on the go.
                    Ensuring that my role was completed quickly and to a high standard was crucial in making sure that everyone else
                    could also get their jobs done.
                </p>
            <li>Asda</li>
                <p>
                    Working as a member of the Fresh and Chilled department, a large amount of time was spent out on the shop floor
                    stacking shelves and identifying products about to go out of date. This also meant I came into regular contact
                    with customers who may have needed help with a variety of things, such as wanting to know where a particular product
                    was or specific information about it. This allowed me to work on my employee-customer relationship and take pride
                    in always delivering a polite and helpful service.
